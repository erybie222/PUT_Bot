"""Building the WIiTek agent and the evaluation judge model, and asking the agent a question.

The agent is a LangChain tool-calling agent: an OpenAI chat model, the
read-only database tools from ``database.repository`` and the system prompt
from ``templates``. It decides by itself which tools to call for a question.

The agent remembers conversations: every question is asked within a
conversation (``thread_id``), and the agent sees that conversation's earlier
questions, answers and tool results. A new ``thread_id`` starts from nothing.
