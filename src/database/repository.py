"""The database lookups the agent can call, one per table.

Each function here wraps one ``get_*`` query from ``database/queries`` as a
LangChain tool. **Their docstrings are written for the model, not for
developers**: LangChain sends the docstring, including the ``Args:``
section, to the model as the tool's description, and the model decides from
it when and how to call the tool. Editing a docstring changes how the agent
behaves, so re-run the evaluation afterwards.

Each tool returns its result twice: as a JSON string, which is what the
model reads, and as the original Python rows, which LangChain keeps in
``ToolMessage.artifact`` for the evaluation. The JSON is produced here rather
than by LangChain because LangChain turns an empty list into an empty message
instead of ``"[]"``, and the model would not see that nothing was found.

Every call borrows its own database connection and returns it at the end.
