"""Turning database rows into dictionaries that can be converted to JSON.

Tool results are sent to the model as JSON, but some values the database
returns — ``Decimal`` (e.g. threshold points), ``datetime`` and ``time``
(e.g. office hours) — cannot be written as JSON directly. Every query
builds its result rows with ``row_to_dict`` so this never fails.
