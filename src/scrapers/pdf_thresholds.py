"""Scraper for the admission thresholds PDF published by the university.

The PDF has one table on its first page: one row per major, and for each of
the last five recruitment years two columns — number of places and minimum
points. Only the first recruitment round is listed.

Which column holds which year is read from the table's header (e.g.
"2025/2026 limit przyjęć", "2025/2026 min liczba pkt."), so a new PDF with a
shifted year range needs no code change. A header that does not look like
that stops the step instead of storing numbers under a guessed year.

Majors are matched to the database by name, so they must be ingested first.
