"""Scraper for Informator PP, the university's staff directory.

Collects the faculty's units (institutes, zakłady, offices), its staff, their
administrative functions and their weekly office hours.

Informator is used through the same JSON API its website calls
(``https://informator.put.poznan.pl/?do=<Controller.Action>``). Most of it is
behind a captcha that has to be solved once per session in a browser, so the
scraper borrows that browser session: INFORMATOR_SESSION in ``.env`` holds
the session cookie. When the cookie is missing or has expired,
``InformatorSessionError`` is raised.

The API often sends ``null`` where an object or text is expected, which is
why the code below writes ``(x.get(key) or {})`` instead of
``x.get(key, {})`` — the latter only helps when the key is missing.
