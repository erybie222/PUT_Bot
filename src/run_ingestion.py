"""Load all WIiT data into the database: ``uv run src/run_ingestion.py``.

Steps, in order (later steps depend on earlier ones):

1. the WIiT faculty row;
2. every major, and the courses from its ECTS catalog page;
3. admission thresholds from the PDF — matched to the majors from step 2 by name;
4. faculty units, staff, their functions and office hours from Informator.

Everything runs in one transaction that is committed at the end, so a crash
leaves the database as it was. Two steps are exceptions, reported and skipped
instead of undoing the rest: step 3 when the PDF is missing or not laid out as
expected, and step 4, which needs a browser cookie that often expires (staff
saved before the failure are kept).

Do not commit partway through: step 4 deletes staff and units that this run
did not write, and recognises them by a ``last_updated`` older than the
transaction's start. A commit in between would make everything written
before it look stale.
